## Project Objectives

- Build an App using React, Redux, Node and Sequelize.
- Affirm and connect the concepts learned.
- Learn best practices.
- Learn and practice the GIT workflow.
- Use and practice testing.

## Description

- List food recipes with relevant information from the api [spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
- Search recipes
- Filter / Sort 
- Create new own recipes

__IMPORTANT__: For the filtering and sorting functionalities, you can NOT use the external API endpoints that already return the filtered or sorted results, but you must do it yourself. In particular, some of the sorting or filtering must be done from the frontend.

### Only Endpoints/Flags that can use

- GET <https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch>
- GET <https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/{id}/information>

### Minimum requirements

The minimum requirements for the approval of the individual project will be detailed below. Those who want to add more functionality will be able to do so. As for the visual design, there will be no predetermined wireframes or prototypes, but they will have the freedom to do it as they like, but they will have to apply the knowledge of styles seen in the course so that it is pleasing to the eye.

__IMPORTANT__: It will not be allowed to use external libraries to apply styles to the application. They will have to use CSS with some of the options that we saw in that class (pure CSS, CSS Modules or Styled Components)
